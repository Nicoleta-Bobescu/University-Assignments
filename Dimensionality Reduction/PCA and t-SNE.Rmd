## Introduction

What is freedom? It is a question that has echoed through the realms of philosophy, politics, and human consciousness for centuries. Freedom is more than just a word, it is a concept that shapes societies, defines individual aspirations, and serves as the cornerstone of human progress. For instance, the national ethos of the United States is the widely known "American Dream"---a compelling narrative that encapsulates the belief in individual freedom and the limitless possibilities that await each citizen. This dream, with its roots reaching back to the nation's founding principles, has fueled the aspirations of countless individuals who seek prosperity.

Yet, the concept of freedom is not confined to the borders of any single nation. It transcends geographical boundaries and cultural nuances, manifesting in diverse forms across the globe. Whether expressed through the struggle for civil rights, the pursuit of economic liberties, or the quest for political autonomy, the essence of freedom remains a universal truth that resonates in the hearts of people worldwide.

How does one quantify freedom? Without an objective measure, it is difficult to determine whether a specific action contributes to an increase or decrease in freedom, imparts stability or instability to freedom, or whether freedom itself yields superior outcomes (McMahon and Dowd, 2014). Thankfully, such a tool is already available---the Human Freedom Index (HFI). Developed collaboratively by the Fraser Institute in Canada, the Liberales Institut in Germany, and the Cato Institute in the United States, the HFI project aims to establish a comprehensive and objective measure of freedom.

The present assignment will analyze the HFI data using statistical methods in an attempt to bridge the gap between abstract concepts and concrete measurements. Specifically, I will be using PCA and t-SNE to help uncover hidden structures, visualize trends, and provide actionable insights, facilitating the identification of opportunities for improvement and policy refinement.

## Data description and preparation

The data comes from the HFI for the year 2016, containing insights from 162 countries and 112 distinct indicators of personal and economic freedom in many different areas such as rule of law, religion, relationships, and freedom to trade internationally, among others. The index is presented on a scale from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher levels of freedom. It is important to note that the specific rankings and scores for individual countries can vary each year, and the index is updated annually to reflect changes in the relevant data. The 2016 version can be accessed at <https://www.cato.org/human-freedom-index/2016>, and the archives at <https://www.cato.org/search/category/human-freedom-index>.

The data contains variables with a large proportion of missing data. For example, "pf_identity_legal" (legal gender) is missing \~86% of its data, and this needs to be resolved before any statistical analysis can proceed. The first step in handling missing data involved eliminating columns (variables) with more than 10% missing values, as missing data exceeding this threshold can introduce bias in statistical analyses (Bennett, 2001). This resulted in 44 variables being removed, 15 of them pertaining to personal freedom, and 29 to economic freedom. Then, any missing values in the remaining variables were imputed using the mean for each variable. Lastly, data was filtered to only contain the most recent observations, those for the year 2016. After all data manipulation, the data set was left with 68 active variables.

```

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Why PCA?

The HFI data contains dozens of variables representing different aspects of human freedom, further split between personal and economic freedom. PCA is a good choice here for three main reasons: 1) dimensionality reduction, PCA can reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining as much of the original variability as possible, which helps identify the most important components within; 2) correlation exploration: PCA can reveal underlying patterns and relationships between variables; and 3) visualization: PCA facilitates the visualization of complex data by reducing is dimensionality, making it easier to plot and understand the overall structure and the relationships within the data.

```{r}
# PCA 1
res1 <- PCA(hfi_active, graph = F) # all variables
res1
```

### Graphs

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=10, dpi=400}
# Plotting PCA results: variables graph
plot(res1, choix = "var")
```

The PCA graph of variables shows the contribution of each variable to the principal components (henceforth PC). PCs can be though of as new variables that result from the transformation of the original variables through PCA. Each original variable is represented as a vector in the plot, and the length and direction of the vector indicate the variable's contribution to the corresponding PC. Thus, longer vectors represent variables that contribute more to the PC, while shorter vectors have less influence. Their direction shows the relationship between variables and PCs: variables pointing in the same direction are positively correlated, while those pointing in opposite directions are negatively correlated.

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=10, dpi=400}
# Plotting PCA results: individuals graph
plot(res1, choix = "ind")
```

The PCA graph of individuals shows where each individual observation is represented in the PC space. This plot helps visualize the relationship and (dis)similarities between observations. The position of each point in the plot is determined by its scores on the PCs. Points that are close to each other are similar in terms of personal and economic freedom. The distance of a point from the origin indicates the overall contribution of the individual to the PCs. Thus, points that are farther from the origin contribute more to the variability in the data, while points that are closer to the origin contribute less. Here, clusters in the plot may indicate groups of similar observations, found through underlying patterns in the data.

### Eigenvalues

The cumulative percentage of variance explained (PVE) plot below provides a visual aid for deciding how many PCs to retain in the analysis. It helps visualize the proportion of total variability in a data set that is accounted for by each successive PC. It is most commonly used to find an "elbow", or the point at which adding more components provides diminishing returns in terms of explaining the variance. In this case, there is no clear or sharp elbow, so we can inspect the numbers instead. Looking at the eigenvalues, we can see that 1 PC explains \~29% of the variance, 2 PCs explain \~39% of the variance, and 3 PCs explain \~45% of the variance. In this case, choosing to retain the first 3 PCs is appropriate, although still not ideal---as most of the variance still remains unexplained.

```{r out.height="100%", out.width="100%", dpi=400}
# Plotting the cumulative PVE and inspecting eigenvalues
plot(res1$eig[, 3], type="o", main = "Cumulative percentage of variance explained") 
head(res1$eig, 10)
```

### Contributions of each variable

```{r}
# Inspecting contributions of each variable
head(res1$var$contrib, 10)
```

Each column (Dim.1, Dim.2, etc.) represents a PC, they are the axes that capture the most variance in the data. Each row corresponds to a variable in the data set. The values represent the contribution each variable has to each PC. The higher the value, the more it contributes to that particular PC. This is where the particularities of each PC become more salient, and we can identify what they measure.

Looking at the first PC, Dim.1, the variables "ef_trade" (freedom to trade internationally), "pf_rol" (rule of law), and "ef_trade_regulatory" (regulatory trade barriers) have the highest contributions (3.65247700, 3.56682655, and 3.41269230, respectively). Thus, PC 1 seems to represent a broad measure of economic freedom with a focus on international trade, regulatory trade barriers, and the rule of law. It reflects the extent to which a country allows international trade, the regulatory environment for trade, and the overall legal framework supporting economic activities.

Looking at the second PC, Dim.2, the variables "pf_religion_restrictions" (legal and regulatory restrictions), "pf_religion" (religious freedom), and "ef_regulation_business" (business regulation) have the highest contributions (4.86493603, 4.68374675, and 4.46304350, respectively). Thus, PC 2 seems to reflect the interplay between legal and regulatory restrictions on religion, religious freedom, and the regulatory environment for businesses. It reflects the extent to which a country maintains control over religious practices and sets the regulatory framework for businesses.

Looking at the third PC, Dim.3, the variables "ef_money_currency" (freedom to own foreign currency bank account), "ef_trade_tariffs" (tariffs), and "pf_expression_killed" (press killed) have the highest contributions (7.691447277, 7.398099711, and 5.933321365, respectively). Thus, PC 3 seems to provide a measure that reflects financial freedom, trade tariffs, and the protection of freedom of expression. It reflects the extent to which a country navigates economic openness, regulatory policies in international trade, and the protection of freedom of expression.

### Quality of representation of each variable

```{r}
# Inspecting the quality of representation
head(res1$var$cos2, 10)
```

The squared cosine values (cos2) represent the quality of representation of each variable on each PC. Their values range from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating high quality of representation, and values closer to 0 indicating poor representation. Thus, a variable with a higher value is well-represented by the corresponding PC, whereas a variable with a lower value does not contribute much to that PC.

-   PC 1 has the variables with the best quality of representation. The variables "ef_trade" (freedom to trade internationally) and "pf_rol" (rule of law) have the highest cos2 values across all PCs (0.718510298 and 0.701661258, respectively), indicating that they are highly representative of PC 1.
-   PC 2 has "pf_religion_restrictions" (legal and regulatory restrictions) and "pf_religion" (religious freedom) as its top 2 variables in terms of quality of representation (0.3427298562, and 0.3299652531, respectively). Even though these are the highest values, they are rather low and poorly representative.
-   PC 3 has "ef_money_currency" (freedom to own foreign currency bank account) and "ef_trade_tariffs" (tariffs) as its top 2 variables (0.2937443748 and 0.2825411260, respectively). Again, quite low and poorly representative.

### Results

```{r include=FALSE}
# Exploring results
explor(res1)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# Plotting results
res <- explor::prepare_results(res1)
explor::PCA_var_plot(res, xax = 1, yax = 2, var_sup = FALSE, var_sup_choice = ,
    var_lab_min_contrib = 0, col_var = NULL, labels_size = 10, scale_unit = TRUE,
    transitions = TRUE, labels_positions = NULL, xlim = c(-1.1, 1.1), ylim = c(-1.1,
        1.1))
```

![](Rplot.png)

Exploring the results through the variables plot and data, it seems that Axis 1 (PC 1) is likely related to factors associated with economic freedom, legal systems, rule of law, and perhaps expressions of control and military influence. The high positive loadings for these variables indicate that countries with higher scores on Axis 1 tend to have greater freedom in the aforementioned dimensions. Axis 2 (PC 2) seems to be associated with religious freedom, regulatory environments for businesses, and aspects of legal and labor regulations. The strong negative loadings for the religion-related variables indicate that countries with higher scores on Axis 2 have more religious freedom. Furthermore, the positive loadings for the regulation-related variables indicate that countries that score higher on Axis 2 are those that exhibit a regulatory environment more favorable to business operations.

```{r include=FALSE}
# Adding supplementary variables and exploring the results
hfi_active_with_supp <- hfi_imputed[, c(1:32, 35:74)]
res1 <- PCA(hfi_active_with_supp, quali.sup = c(1:4))
explor(res1)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# With region
res <- explor::prepare_results(res1)
explor::PCA_var_plot(res, xax = 1, yax = 2, var_sup = TRUE, var_sup_choice = "region",
    var_lab_min_contrib = 0, col_var = "Type", labels_size = 10, scale_unit = TRUE,
    transitions = TRUE, labels_positions = NULL, xlim = c(-6.16, 7.14), ylim = c(-6.7,
        6.6))
```

![](Rplot01.png)

We can go back to the PCA and add the available supplementary variables "year", "ISO_code", "countries", and "region". These will serve the purpose of providing additional information to the analysis. As they are categorical variables, they will not be used in the calculation of PCs, and are incorporated just to aid interpretation. Exploring the results again through the variables plot, we can now see the relative position of each country and region. For example, looking at Axis 1, North America and Eastern Europe are on the far right, indicating they are strongly associated with PC 1, or factors associated with more economic freedom, legal systems, and rule of law. Conversely, Middle East and North Africa are found on the left side, meaning they are strongly associated with the opposite end of PC 1, meaning less economic freedom, legal systems, and rule of law.

```{r include=FALSE}
# With countries
res <- explor::prepare_results(res1)
explor::PCA_var_plot(res, xax = 1, yax = 2, var_sup = TRUE, var_sup_choice = "countries",
    var_lab_min_contrib = 0, col_var = "Type", labels_size = 10, scale_unit = TRUE,
    transitions = TRUE, labels_positions = NULL, xlim = c(-14.7, 8.77), ylim = c(-13.8,
        9.68))
```

![](Rplot02.png)

When looking at the individual countries, there is some overlap as the data set contains 162 different countries, but interpretation is still possible by zooming in or looking at the outliers. Let us keep looking at PC 1: the far right of Axis 1 is represented by counties like New Zealand, the Netherlands, and Denmark. All of them are countries that are considered to be developed, and typically found at the top in measures of economic power, legal systems, and social benefits. Conversely, the far left is represented by countries like Syria, Iraq, and Lybia. These nations are often characterized by lower levels of economic development, challenges in legal systems, and political turmoil. Their placement on the far left of Axis 1 indicates a strong negative association with the characteristics captured by PC 1, highlighting potential issues such as economic constraints, legal challenges, and social disparities. Overall, the alignment of the countries reinforces the association of PC 1 with factors related to economic freedom, legal systems, and the rule of law.

### Discussion

This first PCA analysis explored the relationships and patterns that emerge when considering the entire data set, with both personal and economic freedom variables. This analysis was important because 1) it was able to capture the overall variability in the data, 2) it helped understand the overall structure of the data and identify patterns across all variables, and 3) it considered the relationship between personal and economic freedom.

However, there were some limitations. I would argue that the data set is too large: the visualizations had notable overlap, the cumulative percentage of variance explained was rather low even when considering 3 PCs (\~45%), the contributions of each variable were relatively small and sometimes odd (recall PC3 being associated with freedom to own foreign currency, tariffs, and media killings), and the quality of representation of each variable was low for anything outside of PC 1. One possible explanation is that the variables are highly correlated, so there are none that particularly stand out, but it might also suggest that the data set is characterized by a high degree of complexity or heterogeneity. The limited explanatory power of the first few PCs could be due to the intricate interactions and dependencies among variables, making it challenging to capture a substantial portion of the variability with a small number of components.

## t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)

### Why SNE?

As mentioned before, the HFI data contains a multitude of variables pertaining to different aspects of personal and economic freedom, and t-SNE could be particularly effective in 1) capturing the complex non-linear relationship between the variables, 2) reducing the dimensionality of the data while retaining the essential structure, and 3) highlighting clusters within the data in order to reveal interesting patterns.

```{r fig.height=11, fig.width=11, dpi=400}
# Converting from data frame to matrix to be able to use jitter()
hfi_active_matrix <- as.matrix(hfi_active)

# t-SNE
sne <- Rtsne(jitter(hfi_active_matrix)) # needs jitter because of duplicates

# Defining colors for each region (none of the ggplot2 presets convinced me)
region_colors <- c(
  "Eastern Europe" = "#3498db",
  "Middle East & North Africa" = "#222222",
  "Sub-Saharan Africa" = "#f39c12",
  "Latin America & the Caribbean" = "#2ecc71",
  "Caucasus & Central Asia" = "#ff5733",
  "Oceania" = "#9b59b6",
  "Western Europe" = "#009688",
  "South Asia" = "#e91e63",
  "North America" = "#00796b",
  "East Asia" = "#3f51b5")

# Please zoom in on all visualizations for best clarity and fewest overlaps!
